    "# Building Connect Four\n",
    "To finish this module, you will create a minimax function for a game of [Connect Four](https://codehs.com/share/id/connect-four-LuXrGD/run).\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect Four is similar to Tic Tac Toe - to win, you need to connect four of your pieces in a row, in a column, or diagonal. If you’re unfamiliar with the rules, you can check them out here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your finished product should look something like this game here. This version of the game uses minimax with alpha beta pruning and depth to analyze the board and make a move. Play a couple of times to see if you can beat it!"

    "# Connect Four\n",
    "For this assignment, you will implement a minimax algorithm from scratch that will allow users to play an AI in Connect Four.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code has already been written to get the game to work - all you need to implement is a working minimax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of code already included in this program - most of it you won’t have to do anything with at all, so don’t worry. There are also comments that describe what every function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `minimax()` function on line **356**. To implement minimax, you will need to rely on the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `check_win(player`): This function returns true if a player has won the game. This should be used in the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `check_moves_left()`: This function returns true if there are moves left in the game. If this is false, then the game has ended in a tie. This function should be used in your base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `check_curr_score()`: This function returns the current score of the game board. In Tic Tac Toe, we returned 0 when depth of 0 was reached, but this doesn’t work with Connect Four. Because there are so many more potential moves, certain board set ups are more advantageous than others. For example, if a player has three in a row and an available space to place a fourth, that is more valuable than if three are in a row but one is blocked. This function checks for all available moves and evaluates the game board with a score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Available Black Moves - Available Red Moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should be used in the base case for when the depth reaches zero. The value of `check_curr_score()` should be returned to minimax.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `check_column_depth(col)`: This function returns the correct row to place a player. In Connect Four, players only need to choose a column. The row that the piece is placed at is determined by how many pieces are already in that column. This function takes a column and returns the row that a player can be placed at. When iterating through all potential moves, you only need to iterate through each column, then call `check_col_depth` to determine which row that piece should be placed at.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `place_player(player, row, col)`: This function places a player on the board at the row, col that is specified. This should be called before the next call to minimax so that the new player piece is added before the next evaluation."
