    "# Problem 3 - Tracing Our Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on successfully creating a minimax recursion function! But what exactly is happening during each line of code? Many times, the more complex a program becomes, the more challenging it is to fully understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can better understand our code is to use **print statements**. By printing out specific values at strategic points in our code, we’re able to actually see what the computer is doing behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we can do is step through our program using a **visualization tool**, such as Python Tutor. Python Tutor enables you to input a program and step through it, line by line. It also tracks the values of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directions**: In this exercise, you will use Python Tutor to explore the `minimax` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are new to Python Tutor, watch this [video demo](https://youtu.be/MZ-1uDdv_8Y) first!\n",
    "2. Go to [this website](https://tinyurl.com/cr5jufzb). You should see a program that is similar to the one you created in the previous exercise. However, this program’s `minimax` function includes multiple print statements. Take a look at the code snippet below to find the added print statements.\n",
    "3. Find Step 54. This is where you can start stepping through the `minimax` function.\n",
    "4. Use the Next button to go line by line. You’ll notice that the program will go through every line, so be patient. While this may seem tedious, going through this process will help you truly understand what your program is doing! Pay close attention to variables - Python Tutor uses blue boxes like the one below to keep track of the values.\n",
    "5. As you go step through each line, summarize what is happening in plain English.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do the print statements help you better understand the `minimax` function? Are there any other places you would add a print statement to deepen your understanding of the program?\n",
    "2. In your own words, describe what happens when you call the `minimax` function and there are two spaces left on the board. If you prefer, you can draw a diagram instead of using words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "# Problem 4 - Getting the Row Col Values\n",

    "To start, we need to change the return type of our function. Right now we are returning just the score - from now on, we will return the score, the current row, and the current column. We can do this by returning a tuple that includes the best score coupled with the row and col it can be found at. For the base case, we can return the score, accompanied by the values `None` and `None` to indicate that there is no row, col to return. For example, when checking if there is a winner, the return value would be:\n",
