    "# Determine Finite States\n",
    "This [simple game](https://codehs.com/share/id/determine-finite-states-6b8qy0/run) is an example of a non-character player that uses a Finite State Machine algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible before triggering an alarm. The alarm occurs when the user (the square) is too close to the guard (the circle). You can move your character by using the arrow keys!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the user to move, you’ll have to first click into the window where the game is being run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try playing around with this game and answer the following questions about its behavior, and how it might be improved!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. hat are the different finite states that the guard is able to be in?\n",
    "2. What triggers a change in the guard’s behavior? Try outlining a diagram of the different states and the triggers that lead to a transition from one state to another.\n",
    "3. What other states might a programmer add to the guard in order to make this game more challenging or more fun?\n",
    "4. Should this NPC be considered Artificial Intelligence? Why or why not?\n",
    "5. Think of one of your favorite video games. Describe the finite states for one of the non-player characters in that game."
