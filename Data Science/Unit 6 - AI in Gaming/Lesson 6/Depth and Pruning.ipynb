    "# Adding Alpha Beta Pruning5 points\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to implement alpha beta pruning in our minimax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, changed the parameter list in the definition to include alpha and `beta`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```def minimax(player, depth, alpha, beta):```\n",
    "In all recursive calls to minimax, make sure to add `alpha` and `beta` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get alpha beta pruning to work, alpha needs to be compared to the current score when **maximizing**, and beta needs to be compared to the current score when **minimizing**. If the score is greater than alpha, then the score should replace alpha, and if the score is less than beta, then the score should replace the value of beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `best` and `worst` have been evaluated, create an if statement comparing the value of alpha to beta. If alpha is **greater than** beta in both the maximizer and minimizer, then the program should `break`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If you used a nested for loop to loop through available board spaces, the if statement should come after the *inner* for loop terminates:\n",

    "    for col in board:\n",
    "        //minimax\n",
    "    //if statement goes here\n",

    "Lastly, in your call to minimax in `take_turn`, make sure to set the value of `alpha` to -1000 and `beta` to 1000."
