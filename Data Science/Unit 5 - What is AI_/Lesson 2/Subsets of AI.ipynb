    "# Teachable Machine Exploration\n",
    "In this activity, we’ll get a chance to build our own **classification** machine learning algorithm using Google’s Teachable Machine. Classification algorithms are able to classify images, sounds, and other data into categories based on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are going to try and teach Google’s machine to understand the difference between blue and red.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, head to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image)!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: In order to teach the machine, we need to feed it data that classifies certain images as blue and red. For Class 1, add 3-5 images that capture the color red. For Class 2, add 3-5 images that capture the color blue. You can find these images by using a search engine. Alternatively, you can use physical red and blue objects and capture images of them using the Webcam feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Once you’ve added the correct training data, click the Train Model button. This will train the algorithm to classify new images as red or blue based on the existing images. If you’re interested, click the Advanced settings to learn more about how the algorithm is being trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: When the program is done training, it’s time to test the quality of the classification algorithm. Upload each of [these testing images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mFi9G24R96s53YHCUMO5TrAvYuwH9uTX?usp=sharing) to the model. Use the drop-down to set the input type as a file instead of the webcam. You will only be able to test one image at a time. Is the model accurate? Why or why not? Which images is it accurate for?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Analyze and reflect on your results. You will answer the following questions in the following activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was your model able to accurately predict the color of the test images?\n",
    "- If your model was 100% accurate, why do think this was the case?\n",
    "- If your model was not 100% accurate, which images did it struggle with? Why do you think this is the case? What do you think you do to make your model more accurate?"
